He is a\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124\/42 (following\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2\/6\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\npulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\n\nRADIOLOGY\/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\nthe chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\npneumonia.\n\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\nnonspecific inferior\/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].\n\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\npartially calcified prostate gland.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\n\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\n\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\n\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\npressure.\n\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\n\nA repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\nof [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\n\nOn [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\n\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\npatient had been made do not resuscitate\/do not intubate\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\n\nBy [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\n\nOn the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\nalthough, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\nenzymes.\n\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\non [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\n\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE\/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\ngentamicin and piperacillin\/tazobactam in addition to the\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\nfluids.\n\nOn [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\n[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin\/tazobactam was\ndiscontinued on [**2101-10-29**].\n\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\nnegative on [**2101-10-28**].\n\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\nhe was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\nrespiratory secretions.\n\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\n\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\nheart-healthy\/diabetic diet.\n\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\nwound healing.\n\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\npacked red blood cells on [**2101-10-27**] to maintain a\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\nremained stable.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehabilitation facility.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n 1.

He denied pain at 8PM but did c\/o discomfort and requested something to relax him. He was given 2mg IV ativan and did well. No further sedation required overnight. Pt MAE. Nods ead to questions. Has good cough and gag. His family say his baseline is pleasant but forgetful. He does reach to pull out the ETT when left untied so he is restained for safety.\n\nCardiac: BP stable 120-130\/60. Pt is on Amiodarone via NGT TID. Tolerating this well. HR 80-95 most of the shift. Has rare to occ. PVC\/APC. Swan numbers done Q6hrs as ordered and probably swan will come out today. CVP 7-9, PCW 16-20, CO [**7-15**] and SVR 800-900. He remains on heparin drip which needed to be decreased to 750u\/hr at 11PM for PTT 110. Repeat PTT will be sent at 5AM.\n\nResp: Stable gas on AC 14, TV 500, FIO2 30% with 5cm peep. Plan to put pt on PSV early today and try to extubate him. The team needs to meet with the family and decide on if he wil be reintubated if he fails. He has been suctioned for thick pale yellow to white secretions. Lungs are coarse.\n\nGI: Pt is NPO except for meds. +BS noted. No stool.\n\nGU: UO excellent via foley. Urine is cloudy\/sedimented.\n\nID: Pt is afebrile. Lactic acid is 1.0.

She\nquit tobacco five years ago.  No alcohol.  No illicit drugs.\nNo intravenous drug use.  No transfusions.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the\npatient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,\nher respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117\/57,\nand her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6\nliters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She\nwas unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was\ncachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination\nrevealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The\nextraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was\nsupple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax\nrevealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.\nCardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were\nno murmurs.  The abdomen revealed mild diffuse tenderness to\npercussion, hepatomegaly 6 cm below the costal margin, no\nspleen palpated, positive bowel sounds.  There was no rebound\nor guarding.  Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.\nPulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial\nnerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was [**5-18**] in all\nextremities.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had\na white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%\nlymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\nfor 30 protein.\n\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY\/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from [**2187**].\n\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\n\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE\/SYSTEM:\n\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\nwas transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit secondary\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\n\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\nlow PAO2.\n\nIn the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\nwere negative.\n\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\n\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\nadmission from [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] grew out\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ([**4-19**] blood\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\ncultures.\n\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\nsurveillance blood cultures from [**3-17**] on were negative,\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\n\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in [**2190-10-13**].  Her\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]\nin [**2191-4-14**] for a visit.\n\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\nwas within normal limits.\n\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\nto follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] in clinic over the next two\nweeks.\n\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\n\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\nLevoxyl.\n\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\nline was placed on [**2191-3-19**] for intravenous antibiotics.\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\nto follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for cirrhosis and with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\nfollow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4390**] next\nFriday for primary care.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n 1.

The native renal arteries are identified and are\n patent, but the native kidneys are small and shrunken, consistent with known\n history of renal impairment. The common iliac arteries are patent bilaterally.\n\n RIGHT SIDE:\n On the right side, the patient's transplant kidney can be seen in the right\n iliac fossa. The transplant graft renal artery is widely patent.  There is a\n clearly patent anastomosis between the right external iliac artery and the\n graft artery. The external iliac artery is mostly widely patent but 2.7 cm\n below the site of insertion of the graft kidney, there is a short focal area\n of asymmetrical narrowing. The cause of this is uncertain; it may represent an\n eccentric clot or a thrombus formation, but a very short focal dissection\n cannot be excluded. The right external iliac artery is otherwise widely patent\n as is the common femoral artery. The right superficial femoral artery is\n widely patent throughout its length. The right above- and below- knee\n popliteal arteries are also widely patent. Although not specifically\n evaluated, the popliteal artery gives off a patent anterior tibial and\n peroneal artery which appear patent to the level of the ankle.\n\n LEFT SIDE:  The left common iliac and external iliac arteries are widely\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2175-9-4**] 7:38 AM\n MRA LOWER EXT W&W\/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN               Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 18346**]\n Reason: iliac [**Last Name (un) 1115**] stenosis right;, S\/P renal transplant\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n patent.

She was started on dialysis in [**2174-2-7**].  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on [**2175-5-30**] for\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\nand will have a final T & B cell class match prior to\ntransplantation.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\nOccasional alcohol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124\/58; heart rate 76; weight\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2175-5-30**], the patient went to the\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\nby Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and assisting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see details\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] came to assist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Again, please see\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\n\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\n2 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\n\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\nyesterday which was on [**2175-5-30**] with a small amount of pelvic\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\nHer heparin was discontinued on [**2175-6-1**]. The patient received\n1\/2 cc per cc of replacement and on [**6-1**], Tacrolimus was\nstarted.  On [**2175-6-2**], the patient had some complaint of right\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On [**2175-6-2**],\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on [**6-2**], PT was 13.5,\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\n\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\nhad another ultrasound on [**2175-6-6**] because there was blood in\nher [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\ninterval change or resolution.\n\nOn [**2175-6-9**], the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\nfemoral veins which had developed since [**2175-6-2**]. There\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\neventually removed, continued on [**2175-6-12**] with drain output of\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\nprn.
